Our approach in this new edition remains what it was in the first edition, published nearly 15 years ago: to provide students and instructors an economics text that delivers complete economics coverage with many real-world business examples. Our goal has been to teach economics in a “widget-free” way by using real-world business and policy examples. We are gratified by the enthusiastic response from students and instructors who have used the first six editions of this book and who have made it a best-selling economics textbook.
