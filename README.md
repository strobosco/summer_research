# Summer Research Code Repository

This repository contains all code related to EMG sensing wearables used for real-time facial reconstruction. Below
I've described the layout of the repository:

```
+-- arduino_code: arduino code used on sensors
|
+-- initial_testing: initial code for data gathering/processing
|
+-- static_classification: contains all code used to create the pipeline for static classification of facial expressions using the EMG sensors
|
+-- tests: contains all the `.txt` files to allow users to view the same results obtained in my testing
```
