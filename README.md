# Summer Research Code Repository

This repository contains all code related to EMG sensing wearables used for real-time facial reconstruction. Below
I've described the layout of the repository:

- *arduino_code* --> contains all arduino code used for sensor data collections
- *initial_testing* --> contains all code used in the first month of research for preprocessing and data gathering
- *static_classification* --> contains all code used to create the pipeline for static classification of facial expressions using the EMG sensors
- *test* --> contains all the `.txt` files to allow users to view the same results obtained in my testing
